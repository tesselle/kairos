## Overview

A toolkit for absolute dating and analysis of chronological patterns. This package includes functions for chronological modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages from count data. It allows to compute time point estimates and density estimates of the occupation and duration of an archaeological site. **kairos** provides methods for:

* Mean ceramic date estimation [@south1977]: `mcd()`
* Event and accumulation date estimation [@bellanger2012]: `event()`
* Aoristic analysis [@ratcliffe2000]: `aoristic()`
* Chronological apportioning [@roberts2012]: `apportion()`

## Installation

You can install the released version of **kairos** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("kairos")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/kairos")
```

## Usage

```{r packages-load}
## Load packages
library(kairos)
library(folio) # datasets
```

**kairos** uses a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix. Please refer to the documentation of the [**arkhe**](https://github.com/tesselle/arkhe) package where these classes are defined.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample/case) must be saved in its own row.

```{r aoristic, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
## Aoristic Analysis
data("zuni", package = "folio")

## Set the start and end dates for each ceramic type
dates <- list(
  LINO = c(600, 875), KIAT = c(850, 950), RED = c(900, 1050),
  GALL = c(1025, 1125), ESC = c(1050, 1150), PUBW = c(1050, 1150),
  RES = c(1000, 1200), TULA = c(1175, 1300), PINE = c(1275, 1350),
  PUBR = c(1000, 1200), WING = c(1100, 1200), WIPO = c(1125, 1225),
  SJ = c(1200, 1300), LSJ = c(1250, 1300), SPR = c(1250, 1300),
  PINER = c(1275, 1325), HESH = c(1275, 1450), KWAK = c(1275, 1450)
)

## Keep only assemblages that have a sample size of at least 10
keep <- apply(X = zuni, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) sum(x) >= 10)

## Calculate date ranges for each assemblage
span <- apply(
  X = zuni[keep, ],
  FUN = function(x, dates) range(unlist(dates[x > 0])),
  MARGIN = 1,
  dates = dates
)

## Coerce to data.frame
span <- as.data.frame(t(span))
colnames(span) <- c("from", "to")

## Calculate aoristic sum (weights)
aorist_weigth <- aoristic(span, step = 50, weight = TRUE)
plot(aorist_weigth)

## Rate of change
set.seed(12345)
aorist_roc <- roc(aorist_weigth, n = 30)
plot(aorist_roc)
```
